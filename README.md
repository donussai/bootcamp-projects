## 1. Description
This coding task involves creating simple logic gates using neural networks. Specifically, the task demonstrates how to construct OR, AND, NOR, NAND and XOR gates by defining layers and networks using NumPy arrays for weights and biases. Understanding how to implement these basic neural networks is crucial for grasping more complex concepts in machine learning and deep learning.

## 2. Installation
To run the code provided in this notebook, you need to have Python and the following packages installed:

1. Clone the repository or download the Jupyter notebook file
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
   - jupyter notebook neural_network_task.ipynb
3. Run the cells in the notebook to see the implementation and outputs of the logic gates

### OR Gate
The OR gate is similarly implemented using a neural network layer with appropriate weights and biases to achieve the OR logic.

### AND Gate
The AND gate is implemented using a single layer neural network with weights and biases set to mimic the AND logic.

## NOR Gate
The NOR gate is implemented using a neural network layer with weights and biases configured to achieve the NOR logic. NOR gate is the negation of the OR gate, providing an output of 1 only when both inputs are 0.

## NAND Gate
The NAND gate is implemented using a neural network layer with weights and biases configured to achieve the NAND logic. NAND gate is the negation of the AND gate, providing an output of 1 unless both inputs are 1.

### XOR Gate
The XOR gate is more complex and requires a multi-layer neural network. It demonstrates how combining layers can achieve more complex logic that single layers cannot.
